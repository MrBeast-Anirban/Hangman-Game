# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Here in our code we are going to treat our system as the opponent who will randomly pick up a word for us to guess. The user/player will have a liberty to set the length of the word for our opponent to choose as well as player will be able to declare the number of guesses he/she going to make in order to guess the word's each and every character correctly at the end with 0 guesses left if all the characters guessed correctly will win the game but if not he/she will loose the game. This game is implemented not using object oriented lemmas but with some simple function that are easy to understand. Enjoy!
